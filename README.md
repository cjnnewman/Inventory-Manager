# COP3003 - Project Title: Inventory-Manager
Developer: Caleb Newman

Description: This program is a basic inventory management program. It utilizes C++ and SqLite3 to perform
basic invetory management functions such as adding and removing products, managing quantities, and checking
delivery dates.

Reason: This project was developed due to the lack of a proper inventory management platform at my current
workplace. The project will continue development as I learn more about programming and continue my education
in Software Engineering, while being deployed and utilized at my job.

Maintainers: Caleb Newman
